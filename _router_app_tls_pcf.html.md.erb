By default in all PAS runtimes with Linux cells, the Gorouter communicates with and validates app containers over TLS. To change this setting, do the following:

1. In Ops Manager, click to open the PAS runtime tile that you want to change routing behavior to. This can be a Pivotal Application Service, Isolation Segment, or Small Footprint Runtime tile.

1. Navigate to the **Application Containers** pane.

1. Enable or disable the **Enable Envoy proxy on Garden containers** checkbox. This checkbox configures the Diego cells to run an Envoy proxy for each app instance.
