## <a id="manage-log-levels"></a> Manage Log Levels in Apps Manager

Spring Boot apps include _loggers_ for many provided and user components of the app. You can set the log level for each logger in Apps Manager. 

To view the **Configure Logging Levels** screen, select the **Logs** tab and click the **Configure Logging Levels** button.

Apps Manager displays the default log level for each logger in gray.

You can modify the log level for any logger by clicking the desired level in the logger row as in the image below. Whenever you set a log level, the following happens:

* The log level becomes blue to indicate that it is user-configured.
* Each child namespace of the logger inherits the log level.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can manually set any of the child loggers to override this inheritance.</p>

![Set Log level](set-levels.png)

All of the loggers with user-configured logging levels float to the top of the list.

You can reset log levels by clicking the white dot displayed on the current log level.

You can also filter what loggers you see using the **Filter Loggers** textbox.
