#### <a id="xfcc_haproxy"></a> Terminate TLS at Load Balancer

By default, the Gorouter forwards arbitrary headers that are not otherwise mentioned in this documentation, including the XFCC header.

For apps to receive the XFCC header, configure your load balancer to set the XFCC header with the contents of the client certificate received in the TLS handshake.


To enable this mode:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

1. Select **Networking**.

1. Under **Configure support for the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert header...**, select **TLS terminated for the first time at infrastructure load balancer**.
