This topic describes how to retrieve app and service instance usage information using Apps Manager. 

You can also access the data using the Usage service API, or the [Cloud Foundry API](http://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/) from the cf CLI. For more information, see [Monitoring App and Service Instance Usage](../opsguide/accounting-report.html).

There are two ways to monitor app and service instance usage from Apps Manager. The Accounting Report provides a summarized report, and the Usage Report provides a more detailed view of the data.

The Accounting Report displays instance usage information for all orgs in your [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) deployment except the <strong>system</strong> org. The Accounting Report provides a high-level overview of your usage by displaying your monthly count of app instances.

To access the Accounting Report, you must be [logged into the Apps Manager](../customizing/console-login.html) as an admin.

1. Select **Accounting Report** from the left navigation of Apps Manager.

2. View the average and maximum app instances in use per month under **App Instance Statistics**.

  The maximum is the largest number of app instances in use at any one time. The Accounting Report calculates these values from the `start`, `stop`, and `scale` app usage events in Cloud Controller.

For more information about managing roles, see the [Managing User Accounts and Permissions Using the Apps Manager](../console/console-roles.html) topic.
