This topic discusses how to view and manage orgs and spaces in Apps Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To manage a space, you must have Space Manager permissions in that space.</p>

To perform the following steps, you must first log in to Apps Manager with an 
account that has adequate permissions. See the [Understanding Permissions](dev-console.html#permissions) topic for more information.  

## <a id='view-space'></a>Manage an Org

The following sections describe how to manage your orgs using the org management interface
in Apps Manager.

### <a id="gather-data"></a> See Org Information

The org page displays information on each of the following tabs:

- **Spaces**---The org page shows the following information on each space:
   - Space name
   - The number of apps in that space
   - Number of apps in running, stopped, and crashed states
   - Number of services
   - Memory quota usage
- **Domains**---The org page shows the following information on each domain:
   - The domain name
   - Whether the domain is shared globally or privately
- **Members**---The org page shows the following information on each member:
   - Email address
   - Org Manager permissions
   - Org Billing Manager permissions
   - Org Auditor permissions
- **Settings**---The org page shows the following information:
   - Spaces assigned to isolation segments. For more information, see [Isolation Segments](../concepts/security.html#isolation-segments).


### <a id="nav-orgs"></a> Navigate Between Orgs and Spaces

To view spaces in a different org, you must navigate to that org in Apps Manager.

To navigate to a different org, choose one of the following options:

- Click **Home** and select a different org by **Org Name**.

- Use the global searchbar to find a different org.




### <a id="domains"></a> Manage Domains

In the **Domains** tab, you can do the following:

- See each **Domain** in your org.

- See the **Type** associated with each domain. A type is either **Globally Shared** or
**Privately Shared**. For more information about globally and locally shared domains,
see [Shared Domains](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#shared-domains) and [Private Domains](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#private-domains)
.

- Delete a domain by clicking the vertical three-dot icon and selecting **Delete**.
You must have permission to manage the domain to delete it.

- Create a new private domain by clicking **Add a Domain**. You must have Org
Manager permissions to create a private domain.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>To create globally shared domains, you must have
Admin permissions and use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).
For more information, see [Create a Shared Domain](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#create-a-shared-domain).</p>

See the following screenshot for an example **Domains** interface
with Org Manager permissions:

<%= image_tag("apps-manager-domains-tab.png", :alt => "The screenshot shows the
'Domains' tab selected. At the top of the tab content is an 'Add a Domain' button. Below is a table with
three example domains listed: `apps.internal' which is a 'Global' type, 'apps.test.cf-app.com,'
which is also a 'Global' type, and 'dev.private,' which is a 'Private' type. Only the domain with the 'Private'
type has the horizontal three-dot menu, indicating that the domain can be deleted.") %>
