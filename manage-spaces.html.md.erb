<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic discusses how to view and manage orgs and spaces in Apps Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To manage a space, you must have Space Manager permissions in that space.</p>

To perform the following steps, you must first log in to Apps Manager with an 
account that has adequate permissions. See the [Understanding Permissions](dev-console.html#permissions) topic for more information.  

## <a id='view-space'></a>Manage an Org

The org page displays the spaces associated with the selected org. The left 
navigation of Apps Manager shows the current org. 

![Org Console]( <%= vars.console_org %> )

To view spaces in a different org, use the drop-down menu to change the org. 

![Select Org]( <%= vars.select_org %> )

To view the page for a particular space, click the space on the org page or on 
the left navigation. To create a new space, click **Add a Space** at the bottom 
of the org page.

##<a id='manage-space'></a>Manage a Space

The space page displays the apps, service instances, and routes associated with 
the selected space.
