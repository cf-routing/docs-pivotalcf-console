This topic discusses how to view and manage orgs and spaces in Apps Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To manage a space, you must have Space Manager permissions in that space.</p>

To perform the following steps, you must first log in to Apps Manager with an 
account that has adequate permissions. See the [About Permissions](dev-console.html#permissions) topic for more information.  

## <a id='view-space'></a>Manage an Org

The org page displays the spaces associated with the selected org. The left 
navigation of Apps Manager shows the current org. 

### <a id="spaces"></a> Spaces

In the **Spaces** tab, you can do the following:

- See the following information for each space:
   - Name
   - Number of apps
   - Number of apps in running, stopped, and crashed states
   - Number of services
   - Memory quota usage
- Create a new space

### <a id="domains"></a> Domains

In the **Domains** tab, you can do the following:

- See each **Domain** in your org.

- See the **Type** associated with each domain. A type is either "Private" or "Global".
Global domains are also called shared domains. For more information,
see [Private Domains](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#private-domains)
and [Shared Domains](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#shared-domains).

- Delete a domain by clicking the vertical three-dot icon and selecting **Delete**.
You must have permission to manage the domain to delete it.

- Create a new private domain by clicking **Add a Domain**. You must have Org
Manager permissions to create a private domain.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>To create global domains, you must have
Admin permissions and use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).
For more information, see [Create a Shared Domain](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#create-a-shared-domain).</p>

See the following screenshot for an example **Domains** interface
with Org Manager permissions:

<%= image_tag("apps-manager-domains-tab.png", :alt => "The screenshot shows the
'Domains' tab selected. At the top of the tab content is an 'Add a Domain' button. Below is a table with
three example domains listed: `apps.internal' which is a 'Global' type, 'apps.test.cf-app.com,'
which is also a 'Global' type, and 'dev.private,' which is a 'Private' type. Only the domain with the 'Private'
type has the horizontal three-dot menu, indicating that the domain can be deleted.") %>

### <a id="members"></a> Members

In the **Members** tab, you can do the following:

- See member email addresses
- Toggle member permissions
- Remove member from org
- Invite a new member

### <a id="org-settings"></a> Settings
